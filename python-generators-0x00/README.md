# ProDev Backend – Python Generators

## Overview

This project focuses on **advanced Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks emphasize leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, improving performance and resource utilization in data-driven applications.
